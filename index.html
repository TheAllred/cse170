      <strong> Allred’s User Manual</strong>

      <strong>STYLE:</strong> <p> Y leadership. Peer led with high respect
      and high autonomy. Psychological Safety Stage 4.</p>

      <strong>Values</strong> Respect, accountability, and self-motivation. I
      value high ownership mentality, high respect for the people around you,
      and I value people who have the drive to accomplish difficult things.
<br>    
      <strong>What I don’t have patience for:</strong> Laziness, lack of effort,
      and shirking responsibility. Effort has different results depending on the
      person, but the amount of effort given is entirely dependent on the
      individual. Not giving full effort is a choice and one that I cannot
      tolerate.
<br>
      <strong>Best way to communicate with me:</strong> Quickly, clearly, and
      respectfully. If my fly is down, tell me. Yes, I’ll be embarrassed. Yes,
      I’ll be frustrated, but if you correct me or must communicate with me, do
      it quickly and don’t beat around the bush.

      <strong>Best way to help me:</strong> Correct me when I make mistakes. I’m
      oblivious to much of the things I do. If I am struggling, chance is that I
      can’t see what is causing me to struggle. Do for me what I can’t do for
      myself and point out the things that I don’t see.
<br>
      <strong>Common Misconceptions:</strong> I am a positive person and I try
      to keep a high level of confidence in my abilities. That confidence often
      comes across as arrogance and pride. I don’t want to come across as an
      arrogant prick. I don’t have a know-it-all mind set. I have a learn-it-all
      attitude that if I don’t know something, I am confident that I can learn
      it.
<br>
      <strong>FAULTS/Shortcomings:</strong> Impatient with redundancy and
      shortcomings with myself. I want to make things better and I can often
      become hyper focused on a specific task that I will make mistakes in other
      areas from just not being aware.
